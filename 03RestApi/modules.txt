Modules in nestjs:
A module serves as the foundational building block of a Nest.js application, adhering
to the Nest.js principle of modularity for better code organization

Each Module
encapsulates Providers, Controllers, Imports, and Exports, acting as a cohesive unit of
related functionality.

Providers:(services, factories, or repositories):
They encapsulate business logic and can be injected into controllers or other
services.

Controllers:
it serves the function of handling incoming HTTP requests and sending
responses back to the client

Import:
It is an array that specifies the external modules needed for the current
module, enabling code reusability and separation of concerns.

Exports:
utilized to make services available to other modules

application will contain a Root Module, which is specific to the Nest.js framework. 
The Root Module serves as the entry point and is responsible for instantiating controllers, providers, and other core elements of the application.
this architecture follows the “Module Isolation” principle, ensuring that the
application is organized into distinct functional or feature-based modules.
