Project Structure:
Nest.js serves the src folder as the location where the application source code exists.
This helps in better organisation of files and seperation of concerns.

Overview:
Within the src folder, the main.ts file serves as the entry point of your Nest.js application. 
This file is responsible for bootstrapping the application, utilizing Nest.js’s core function NestFactory to create an instance of your Nest application

Nest factory function:
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";
async function bootstrap() {
    // create a bootstrapping app with app module before assigning a port to listen to requsts
    const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
    await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();

NestFactory is pivotal for bootstrapping the application, setting up the dependency injection system, and
initializing modules. 

Basic and common components of a project Structure
app.controller.ts:
This is a basic controller consisting of one route.
This basically acts as a gateway between client and server.
It is responsible for request handling and response handling for any request.

app.controller.spec.ts: 
This file contains unit tests for the controller, adhering to the Nest.js focus on test-driven development (TDD).

app.module.ts:
This is the root module of the application, which imports other
modules and providers. Nest.js modules act as organizational units and follow
the Single Responsibility Principle.

app.service.ts: A basic service file with a single method. In Nest.js, services
encapsulate business logic and can be injected into controllers, promoting
Dependency Injection and the Separation of Concerns.

nest-cli.json: Utilized for Nest.js-specific configurations, this file allows
customization of compiler options, assets, and other settings.

.prettierrc: This file is used for configuring Prettier, aiding in code formatting and
style consistency within the Nest.js project.

tsconfig.json: This configuration file is for TypeScript and determines how the
TypeScript compiler will behave. This aligns with Nest.js’s use of TypeScript for
strong typing and better code quality.
